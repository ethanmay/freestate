# [FreeState](http://ethanmay.github.io/freestate)

I made this because I saw an app at the top of Product Hunt today called FlowState. I loved the idea of it, but it was being sold for $15.00. I challenged myself to build the same thing using OSS in a day, and this is the result.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.14.0.

-----

## Set up for local dev

Download the repo, run `npm install && bower install`.
Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Building the app

Run `grunt build`. To serve the built version, run `grunt serve:prod`.
