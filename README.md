# [FreeState](https://ethanmay.github.io/freestate)

Improve your writing flow.

Set a writing goal for yourself, then set an expiration timer. If you stop writing, the expiration timer starts. If you don't start writing again, your work will be erased and you will start over.

#### About

I made this because I saw an app at the top of Product Hunt a while back called [FlowState](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/flowstate-2). I loved the idea of it, so I challenged myself to build something similar in less than 24 hours.

----

## Set up for local dev
